# My Personal Project - The Book Store

## About this Project

This application serves as a tool for managing a
company consisting of *various book stores*. It is an
application to be used by a manager/owner of one or more book 
stores in order to keep track of the business 
and represent useful information about the different stores.

The application displays which books are available
in which branches, as well as details about each book including 
the author, reserved status, price and rating. 
In addition to the inventory, it also contains 
information about the books that have been sold from each 
branch.

The entire state of the program can be stored locally, using JSON, 
and loaded back during the next use of the program. Additionally, an 
event log tracks (and prints to the console) all actions completed 
by the user during any given use of the program. Lastly, all the
user stories below (not exhaustive) have been implemented using a 
graphical interface from the Java Swing library.
