# My Personal Project - The Book Store

## About this Project

This application is going to act as a representation of
the inventory in the user's *various book stores*. It is an
application to be used by a manager of one or more book 
stores in order to keep track of their business 
and represent useful information about their various stores.
I am interested in this project because it offers a variety of
different potential **object types and methods** for 
me to work with while developing my Java skill set. Some of 
these object types *may include*

- a book
- a store branch
- an enterprise
- an author

The application will keep track of which books are available
in which branches, as well as details about each book such as 
its author, reserved status, price and rating. 
In addition to the inventory, it will also keep track of 
information about the books that have been sold from each 
branch.

Note: JSON persistence classes modelled around Serialization Demo (UBC CPSC 210).
